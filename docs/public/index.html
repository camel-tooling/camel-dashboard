    <h1>Camel Dashboard Operator</h1>
    <p>The <strong>Camel Dashboard Operator</strong> is a project created to simplify the management of any Camel application on a Kubernetes cluster. The tool is in charge to <strong>monitor any Camel application</strong> and provide a set of basic information, useful to learn how your fleet of Camel (a caravan!?) is behaving.</p>
<p>The project is designed to be as simple and low resource consumption as possible. It only collects the most important Camel application KPI in order to quickly identify what&rsquo;s going on across your Camel applications.</p>
<p>NOTE: as the project is still in an experimental phase, the metrics collected can be changed at each development iteration.</p>
<h2 id="the-camel-custom-resource">The Camel custom resource</h2>
<p>The operator uses a simple custom resource known as <code>CamelApp</code> or <code>capp</code> which stores certain metrics around your running applications. The operator detects the Camel applications you&rsquo;re deploying to the cluster, identifying them in a given namespace or a given metadata label that need to be included when deploying your applications (all configurable on the operator side).</p>
<h2 id="how-to-see-the-dashboard">How to see the dashboard</h2>
<p>As the operator knows about <code>CamelApp</code> custom resource, you can use any Kubernetes tool (<code>kubectl</code>, <code>oc</code>) to visualize it. In order to render the resources graphically we are also developing an <a href="https://github.com/camel-tooling/camel-openshift-console-plugin">Openshift plugin</a> which can be installed separately.</p>
