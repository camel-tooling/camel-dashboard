## Run a new Camel application

Let's run some sample Camel application. We have prepared a few available to run some quick demo:

* A Camel main application available at `docker.io/squakez/db-app-main:1.0`
* A Camel Quarkus application available at `docker.io/squakez/db-app-quarkus:1.0`
* A Camel Spring Boot application available at `docker.io/squakez/db-app-sb:1.0`

These applications were created, exported and "containerized" via Camel JBang, which includes by default the aforementioned `camel-observability-services` dependency.

Let's run them in a Kubernetes cluster (it also works in a local cluster such as `Minikube`):

```bash
kubectl create deployment camel-app-main --image=docker.io/squakez/db-app-main:1.0
```

The application should start, but, since there is no label for the operator, this one cannot discover it.

> NOTE: ideally your pipeline process should be the one in charge to include this and any other label to the applications.

Let's include the label via CLI:

```bash
kubectl label deployment camel-app-main camel.apache.org/app=camel-app-main
```

> NOTE: you can test it straight away with any of your existing Camel application by adding the label as well.

The application is immediately imported by the operator. Its metrics are also scraped and available to be monitored:

```bash
kubectl get camelapps
NAME                PHASE     LAST EXCHANGE   EXCHANGE SLI   IMAGE                                  REPLICAS   INFO
camel-app-413       Running   8m32s           OK             squakez/cdb:4.13                       1          Main - 4.13.0-SNAPSHOT (4.13.0-SNAPSHOT)
```
