Now that Camel Dashboard is installed, you can start using it to monitor and manage your Camel applications. This guide covers:

**For testing and demo purposes:**
* **[Quick Start](quick-start/)** - Get started quickly with pre-built sample applications

**For production usage:**
* **[Camel Project](camel-project/)** - Create a new Apache Camel application using JBang, Quarkus, Spring Boot, or Core runtime
* **[Observability Services](observability-services/)** - Configure Camel applications to expose observability endpoints
* **[Deployment](deployment/)** - Deploy Camel applications to Kubernetes/OpenShift with proper configuration for dashboard discovery

Follow the production sections in order to get your Camel applications up and running with full observability.
