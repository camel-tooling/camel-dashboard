The **Camel Dashboard** is an indispensable tool for anyone managing a fleet of Camel applications. In the fast-paced world of microservices, the ability to quickly visualize and analyze the health and performance of your integration systems is crucial for maintaining operational efficiency and ensuring reliability. Our dashboard provides exactly that.

This project is designed to be as **simple and low-resource as possible**. It's a purpose-built tool that focuses on what really matters. By collecting only the most important Camel application KPIs—like the number of messages exchanged, success rates, failures, and current in-flight statuses—it gives you a **clear, visual overview** of your entire "caravan" of Camel applications.

This isn't just about data; it's about **empowering you with real-time insights**. These insights are essential for quick-view and proactive management of your integrations, enabling you to respond to issues in an instant and enhance overall system performance, stability, and consistency.

With the Camel Dashboard, you can quickly identify what's going on across your applications, giving you the power to keep your systems running smoothly and reliably.
