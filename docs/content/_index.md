The **Camel Dashboard** is a project created to simplify the management of any Camel application on a Kubernetes cluster. 

The tool is in charge to **monitor any Camel application** and provide a set of basic information, with a clear, visual overview, useful to learn how your fleet of Camel (a caravan!?) is behaving.
